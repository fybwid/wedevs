## What will your website look like?
### Planning
1. What is your website about? Do you like dogs, New York, or Pacman?
2. What information are you presenting on the subject? Write a title and a few paragraphs, and think of an image you'd like to show on your page.
3. What does your website look like, in simple high-level terms? What's the background color? What kind of font is appropriate: formal, cartoony, bold and loud, subtle?
